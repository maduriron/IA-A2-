Onthology Architecture

BODY AREA NETWORK

The gateway is the core element of the proposed system and can be implemented on a personal 
digital assistant (PDA), cell phone, or home personal computer. It controls the sensor network
 handling the sensor registration (type and number of sensors), initialization (e.g., specify sampling 
frequency and mode of operation), customization (e.g., run user specific calibration or user-specific
 signal processing procedure upload) as well as the dynamical configuration of the sensor network 
according to the service’s needs. It also has the responsibility to communicate the acquired information
 to the HCC, as well as the actions that must be fulfilled by the system, so that the delivered service 
adapts to the context and the requirements of the patient. The BAN’s gateway encapsulates a variety of processes, such as:

 - data acquisition of the above mentioned heterogeneous sources,

 - local storing and communicating of the acquired data with the HCC,

 - local evaluation of the acquired data and deduction of the patient’s medical condition in case of interruption of the communication connection,

 - patients’ self-evaluation through a proper GUI (Graphical Unit Interface), as well as channelling of advices or commands from the HCC, and

 - determination of a group of events (within the BAN), which occurrence indicates the patient’s current medical condition.
