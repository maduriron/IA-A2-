Abstract:

A medical ontology may be used for computer assisted clinical decision support. 
Multi-level and/or semantically grouped medical ontology is incorporated into a machine learning algorithm. 
The resulting machine-learnt algorithm outputs information to assist in clinical decisions. 
For example, a patient record is input to the algorithm. Based on the incorporated medical ontology, similarities are aggregated in different groups. 
An aggregate similarity of at least one group is a function of an aggregate similarity of at least another group. 
One or more similar patients and/or outcomes are identified based on similarity. Probability based outputs may be provided.


Machine learning algorithms are applied in order to extract useful knowledge in different problem domains by searching for interesting patterns (dependencies) 
in large volumes of data. The principle of instance (patient) similarity is the basis for many machine learning algorithms. 
The main assumption in supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms is that the instances of the same class (cluster) 
are more similar to each other than the instances of different classes (clusters).

OntoNLQA: A method for Ontology-Based Question answering on Biomedical RDF data

->querying RDF data annotated using ontologies which allows posing questions in natural language. 
OntoNLQA offers five steps in order to answer natural language questions.

SparQL -> RDF query language 

Ex.
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
SELECT 
	?diseaseName 
WHERE
  {
    ?disease  a          foaf:Disease .
    ?disease  foaf:diseaseName  ?diseaseName .
  }
