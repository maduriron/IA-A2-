Existing methods:

- Frequency-based methods - Text-to-Onto
- use syntactic patterns and extract concepts matching the patterns
-use wordNet - start from a base word list, for each w in the list , add the hypernyms and hyponyms in WordNet to the list

WORDNET - general lexical knowledge base that contains 150.000 words(noun verb,adj..)
		- a word can have multiple senses
		- each concept is represented by a set of synonyms
		- semantic relations such as hypernym / antonym / meronym of a syn-set are represented

WordNet is a database of English words that are linked together by their semantic relationships. It is like a supercharged dictionary/thesaurus with a graph structure.

Background: Text Processing

Many local election officials and voting machine companies are fighting paper trails, in part
because they will create more work and will raise difficult questions if the paper and electronic

WNSCA + {PE, POP}

Take top n% of NP, and select only those with less than 4 senses in WordNet ==>  obtain  T, a set of noun phrases

Make a base list L of words from T

PE: add to T, any noun phrase np from NP, if the head-word (ending word) in np is in L

POP: add to T, any noun phrase np from NP, if some word in np is in L


TF*IDF: Term Frequency Inverted Document Frequency

TF * IDF(t-ij) = f-ij * Log |D| / |Di| 


|D|:  total number of documents
|Di|: total number of documents containing term ti
TF*IDF(tij): TF*IDF measure for term ti in document dj
 fij:    frequency of term ti in document dj
